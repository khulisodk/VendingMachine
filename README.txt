About The Project: Vending Machine Solution

***************************************************************************************************************************
Approach:

-The fisrt thing was to set up my data source (database) and to get it connected to visual studio as my IDE.
-Second step was to create vending machine table with all necessay fileds and make sure that i able to see it from IDE
-Third step was to build a front end/ web page so that i can be able to display data from the DB to the web page.
-The logic part i had to go to our physical vending machine to perform a real transaction as if i am testing with different
 positive and negative scenarios and that's how i got my logic part:

  > Sucessfull Purchase
  > Cancellation(Refund)
  > Insert Coin
  > Out of Stock
  > Change 

Assumptions:

Working on the logic part i had to assume as if i am at the physical vending machine making an actual purchase as an end user.
